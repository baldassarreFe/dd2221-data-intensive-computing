    "Spark provides GraphX for graphs and graph-parallel computation. To support graph computation, GraphX extends Spark RDD and presents a set of fundamental operators (e.g., subgraph, joinVertices, and aggregateMessages) as well as an optimized variant of the Pregel API. This tutorial is going to get you started with the basics tasks, such as importing graphs in GraphX data strucutres as well as run some analytic tasks like connected components and triangle count."

    "In many cases it is necessary to join data from external collections (RDDs) with graphs. Let's incorporate the in and out degree of each vertex into the vertex property. To do this, we first define a User class to better organize the vertex property and build a new graph with the user property. We initialized each vertex with a 0 in/out degree. Then, we join the in and out degree information with each vertex building the new vertex property. Here we use the outerJoinVertices method of Graph that takes two argument lists: (i) an RDD of vertex values, and (ii) a function from the id, attribute, and Optional matching value in the RDD to a new vertex value."
