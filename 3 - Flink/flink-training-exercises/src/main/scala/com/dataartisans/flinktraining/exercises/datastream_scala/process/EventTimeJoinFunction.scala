/**
  * This is a homegrown join function using the new Flink 1.2 ProcessFunction.
  * Basically, what we do is the following:
  *
  * 1) When we receive a trade we join it against the customer data right away, however
  * to keep this 100% deterministic we join against the latest customer data that
  * has a timestamp LESS THAN the trade timestamp -- not simply the latest available data.
  * In other words we are joining against the customer data that we knew at the time of the trade.
  *
  * 2) We also set a trigger to evaluate the trade again once the watermark has passed the trade
  * time.  Basically, what we're doing here is using event time to ensure that we have
  * "complete" data and then joining again at that time. This will give us a deterministic
  * result even in the face of undordered data, etc
  *
  * This approach has the benefit that you don't introduce any latency into the trade stream
  * because you always join right away.  You then emit a BETTER result if you receive better
  * information.  We use event time in order to know how long we must wait for this potential
  * better information.
  *
  * We also use event time to know when it's safe to expire state.
